README for the gkrellm-wifi Plug-In
===================================

This plug-in monitors the wireless LAN cards in your computer and
displays a graph of the link quality percentage for each card.

The plug-in requires the kernel to have support for the Linux Wireless
Extensions (CONFIG_NET_RADIO).
