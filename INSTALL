Installing the gkrellm-wifi Plug-In
===================================

This plug-in requires GKrellM version 2.1.12 or above and GTK+-2.0 or
above. The plug-in also requires the kernel to have support for the
Linux Wireless Extensions (CONFIG_NET_RADIO).

You can compile this plug-in by running 'make' and copying the
resulting gkrellm-wifi.so file to one of the GKrellM plug-in
directories (or to ~/.gkrellm2/plugins/).
